        <h2>Facts</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>-Benito Mussolini began his political life as a committed socialist. During World War I,  he renounced socialism and adopted fascism.</li>
        <li>-In May 1939, Mussolini signed the Pact of Steel with Adolf Hitler. The Pact committed Italy and Germany to provide military and economic support in event of war. World War II began later that year in September.  .</li>
        <li>-Mussolini was deposed by Italian King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943 and executed by communist partisans in 1945. His body was displayed publicly to prove he was dead.</li>
        <li>-On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, initiating the Second World War. On June 10, 1940, after witnessing Germany’s decisive victories in Poland and France, Mussolini issued a declaration of war on France and Britain. It was clear from the very beginning, however, that Mussolini was not an equal partner with Hitler—and Mussolini did not like that..</li>

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>-In 1935, Mussolini invaded Abyssinia (now Ethiopia) and incorporated it into his new Italian Empire. He provided military support to Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Increasing co-operation with Nazi Germany culminated in the 1939 Pact of Steel. Influenced by Hitler, Mussolini began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation in Italy. His declaration of war on Britain and France in June 1940 exposed Italian military weakness and was followed by a series of defeats in North and East Africa and the Balkans.</li>
            <br>
        <li>-Mussolini’s first act as prime minister was to demand special emergency powers allowing him to rig elections in the Fascists’ favor. Soon after, the Italian parliament made suspicion of being anti-Fascist punishable by imprisonment without trial.</li>
            <br>
        <li>-  Following Italy’s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, Germany was the second country to recognize Italy’s legitimacy there. Both Hitler and Mussolini sided with Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, with Mussolini providing 50,000 troops.</li>
            <br>
        <li>-Mussolini’s obvious pride in his achievement at becoming (October 31, 1922) the youngest prime minister in Italian history was not misplaced. He had certainly been aided by a favourable combination of circumstances, both political and economic; but his remarkable and sudden success also owed something to his own personality, to native instinct and shrewd calculation, to astute opportunism, and to his unique gifts as an agitator.
