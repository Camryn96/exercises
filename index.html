        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>1. Joseph Stalin Was Nominated For The Nobel Peace Award. Twice.
            His actions during World War II and the fierce leadership he shown during those times made Russia a force to be reckoned with, which was instrumental in defeating the Axis nations. In the end, he did not win, since the awards were won by the American politician Cordell Hull in 1945, and in 1948 it was declared deserted.</li>
            <br>
        <li>2. He Was Arrested Eight Times, Exiled, And Managed To Escape Four Times.
            He was accused of collaborating with the royal secret political police, which was never confirmed by any documents. His father’s friends were helping him to escape. He was saved from his last exile sentence by the Revolution in February 1917.
            </li>
            <br>
        <li>3. Stalin Was Named “Man Of The Year” By Time Magazine In Two Different Occasions.
            The first time was in 1939, after he had signed a non-aggression pact with Adolf Hitler in 1939, committing not to attack Germany if they did the same, and leaving Poland open for Germany’s attacks. This pact was broken when Hitler sent his troops to Russia in 1941. The second time was in 1942, now not for his “friendly” attitude towards Germany, who had betrayed him, but for surviving the first wave of the Nazi assault. This was, many consider, the first in Germany’s long list of blunders, because it left them exposed to the Allies attacks on one side, and Russia’s retaliation on the other.
            </li>
            <br>
        <li>4. Stalin Was Not Lenin’s Favorite, But He Ended Up Being His Successor.
            Lenin made clear that he favored Trotsky over Stalin, who he considered to be too cruel, but when death came for Lenin in 1924, Stalin managed to ally himself with two of the most important men in the Communist Party, overthrowing Trotsky’s efforts. Stalin exiled Trotsky in 1929, and had him killed in 1940, getting rid of all manners of competition.
