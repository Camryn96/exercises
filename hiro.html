        <h2>Facts</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>-Hirohito became emperor of Japan on December 25, 1926, following the death of his father. His reign was designated Shōwa (“Bright Peace,” or “Enlightened Harmony”). The Meiji Constitution (promulgated 1889) had invested the emperor with supreme authority, but in practice he generally gave his assent to policies formulated by his ministers and advisers. On occasion, however, he asserted his authority, most notably when he ordered the suppression of an attempted coup by several military officers in February 1936..</li>
        <li>-Hirohito was Japan's longest-reigning emperor, holding the throne from 1926 to 1989. He was a controversial figure who announced Japan's surrender to the Allied Forces in 1945..</li>
        <li>-In November 1921, shortly after his return to Japan, Hirohito was appointed acting ruler of Japan due to his father's failing health. On January 26, 1924, he married Princess Nagako (later Empress Nagako), a distant cousin of royal blood. The couple would eventually have seven children.</li>
        <li>-Shortly after Hirohito's induction as emperor, Japan found itself in a state of unrest. While his reign saw an incredible amount of political turmoil, he remained a gentle man who allegedly had limited influence over the military and its politics. Soon, the military began to revolt, resulting in the assassination of many public officials, including Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi..</li>

            Emperor Hirohito
            Hirohito (1901-1989), known posthumously as Emperor Shōwa, was emperor of Japan during World War II and is Japan’s longest-serving monarch in history.
            
             
            
            BACKGROUND
            
            Hirohito was born in Tokyo during the Meiji Period to the son of the reigning emperor. His father ascended the throne in 1912. In 1921, Hirohito visited Europe; a first for a crown prince of Japan. He was married in 1924 and became emperor in 1926 (after serving as regent for his father).
            
            The emperor was regarded by many as a divine figure according to the traditions of Buddhist and Shinto sects in Japan. In this same tradition, the Japanese nation and race were divinely chosen and protected..
